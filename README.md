ðŸ•’ Stopwatch Web Application â€” Task by The Prodigy Company
As part of an internship assignment provided by The Prodigy Company, I was tasked with creating a fully functional Stopwatch Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to build an interactive and user-friendly timer that includes core stopwatch features with an attractive design.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
HTML for structuring the webpage.

CSS for styling and creating a modern, responsive user interface.

JavaScript for adding real-time functionality and user interactions.

âœ… Features Implemented:
Start, Pause, and Reset Controls

Users can start, pause, and reset the stopwatch at any time.

Lap Time Recording

A "Lap" button allows users to capture and view multiple time checkpoints.

Live Time Display

Displays time in HH:MM:SS format that updates every second.

Lap List Display

Shows all recorded laps in an ordered list, labeled as "Lap 1", "Lap 2", etc.

Modern UI Design

Gradient background with styled buttons and smooth hover effects.

Clean layout with rounded containers and responsive design elements.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
This project allowed me to demonstrate my front-end web development skills and apply real-time JavaScript logic in a practical, user-focused task. Completing this assignment not only helped me strengthen my coding ability but also improved my understanding of creating intuitive user interfaces.
